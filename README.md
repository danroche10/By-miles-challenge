Hey!

A few notes on the challenge:

- An access token is provided for all user credentials. I have assumed that in reality, a token would only be provided for registered users.

- I have assumed the policy API would contain data for many users rather than just one.

- I have added a couple of tests to App.test.js

- I decided to use to 'fetch' rather than 'axios' for example as I wanted to keep the app as simple as possible.

- I stored the access token in local state. For a more comprehensive version of this app I would have stored the access token in local storage or session storage.

- I did most of the work on this app across two afternoons.
